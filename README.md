# Algorithms and performance benchmarking

### A place to store my experimentation with various algorithms, using Rust or C++, and to showcase multi-threaded performance tuning and benchmarking.

### C++ projects are currently built to C++20, although I will move to C++23 soon, and you should be able to find CMakeLists for each algorithm/project.
